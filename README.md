# Presto

Presto is a powerful package designed to facilitate analysis on the multiverse of latent representations. The name Presto stands for PRojected Embedding Similarity based on Topological Overlays.

## Features

Presto offers a wide range of features to support analysis on latent representations:

- Atom integration: Presto seamlessly integrates with Atom, a popular text editor, providing a smooth workflow for analyzing latent representations.
- Topological overlays: Presto utilizes topological overlays to visualize and compare latent representations, enabling users to gain insights into the structure and relationships within the data.
- Projected embedding similarity: Presto calculates similarity scores between projected embeddings, allowing users to measure the similarity between different representations and identify patterns or clusters.
- Multiverse analysis: Presto supports analysis on multiple latent representations simultaneously, enabling users to explore and compare different representations within the same dataset.

With its powerful features and user-friendly interface, Presto is a valuable tool for researchers and data scientists working with latent representations.
