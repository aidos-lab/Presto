# Presto üé∂

## Confidently and efficiently navigate the multiverse üß≠üöÄ

The world of machine learning research is riddled with small decisions, from data collection, cleaning, into model selection and parameter tuning. Each combination of data, implementation, and modeling decisions leads to a potential universe where we can analyze and interpret results. Together, these form a multiverse! üåå

In this project, we focus on mapping out the multiverse of latent representations, specifically targeting machine learning tasks that produce embeddings. In our [ICML 2024 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01514), we develop topological tools to efficiently measure the structural variation between representations that arise from different choices in a machine learning workflow. Our main contribution is a custom score developed specifically for multiverse analysis:

`Presto`, our *Pr*ojected *E*mbedding *S*imilarity based on *T*opological *O*verlays. üîç‚ú®

## Installation

You can install Presto using pip:

`pip install presto-multiverse`

## Basic Usage

### Presto

```python
import numpy as np
from presto import Presto
from sklearn.random_projection import GaussianRandomProjection as Gauss

#Compare Two Embeddings X,Y based on a collection of low-dimensional random embeddings

X = np.random.rand(1000,10)
Y = np.random.rand(1000,12)

presto = Presto(projector=Gauss)

dist = presto.fit_transform(X,Y,n_projections = 20,n_components=2,normalize=True)

print(f"Presto Distance between X & Y : {dist}")
```

### Atom

We also provide an `Atom` class that supports *A*pproximate *T*opological *O*perations in the *M*ultiverse.
When considering a collection of representations that arise from a multiverse, we provide functionality for producing Multiverse Metric Spaces (MMS) that we introduce in our work. Given a collection of embeddings, an MMS encodes the pairwise distance between topological descriptors as computed by `Presto`.

```python
import numpy as np
from presto import Atom

# A list of embeddings in the multiverse
data = [np.random.rand(100, 10) for _ in range(3)]

atom = Atom(data)
atom.compute_MMS(parallelize=True)
print(atom.MMS)
```

## Features

### Normalization & Projection

Presto provides a method to normalize spaces by approximating their diameter. This ensures the embeddings are scaled appropriately before further processing. This class also allows a user to you to project high-dimensional embeddings into a lower-dimensional space using your method of choice! We recommend methods like PCA or Gaussian Random Projection. When using random projections, we encourage the user to produce many random embeddings‚Äì `Presto` uses the distrubution of these low-dimensional representations to build topological descriptors of each space.

### Presto Distance

Presto first fits a topological descriptor to each high dimensional embedding: in particular we build persistence landscapes based on the projections of the embedding. When dealing with a distribution of projections, we fit landscapes to each projection and aggregate the topological information into an average landscape, a well defined notion thanks to the great work by [Bubenik et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.6437) The presto distance between embeddings X,Y is then computed as the landscape distance between the fitted topological descriptors.

### Presto Sensitivity

Presto also offers methods to evaluate the sensitivity of the embeddings' topological structure. By using the statistical properties afforded by persistence landscapes, we compute variance-based scores to evaluate the sensitivity and stability of embeddings with respect to different data, implementation, and modeling choices. `Presto` supports functionality to calculate various versions of sensitivity within a multiverse.

### Clustering and Compression

Using the `Atom` class, you can compute Multiverse Metric Spaces (MMS) that encode pairwise Presto distances between embeddings. Once you have an MMS, there are lots of cool things to do in this space: we provide functionality for clustering your embeddings with Scikit-learn's [AgglomerativeClustering](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering.html) and compressing your embedding space using a greedy approximation of a set cover algorithm.

### Generating Embeddings

Coming soon! We will also support a framework for generating various embeddings from models like VAEs, Transformers, and Dimensionality reduction algorithms.
